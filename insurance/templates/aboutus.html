      <p>Are you feeling overwhelmed by the multitude of components in your insurance policy? Don’t fret, you’re not alone. Insurance policies can be intricate and perplexing, but it’s crucial to comprehend what your policy covers and what it might overlook. Knowing how to read the different parts of an insurance policy is important, so you can completely grasp your insurance policy in and out.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
      <h4 class="section-title">Declarations Page</h4>
